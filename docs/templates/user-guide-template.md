## Overview

### What is [Feature Name]?

Explain what this feature does and why it's useful. Include:

- **Primary purpose and benefits**: What problem does this feature solve?
- **Key capabilities**: What are the main things you can do with it?
- **When to use this feature**: Provide common use cases and scenarios.
- **How it fits into the broader pysearch ecosystem**: How does it interact with other features?

### Key Features

- **Feature 1**: A brief, outcome-oriented description.
- **Feature 2**: Another key capability.
- **Feature 3**: A third important aspect.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

The fastest way to get started with [Feature Name] is with this simple example:

```python
from pysearch import PySearch, SearchConfig

# Basic setup
config = SearchConfig(paths=["./src"])
engine = PySearch(config)

# Use the feature
result = engine.[feature_method]("example")
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

### First Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through a complete, step-by-step example:

```python
# Step 1: Import required modules
from pysearch import PySearch, SearchConfig
from pysearch.types import [RelevantTypes]  # e.g., ASTFilters

# Step 2: Configure the feature
config = SearchConfig(
    paths=["./src"],
    # Feature-specific configuration
    [feature_option]=True
)

# Step 3: Create the search engine
engine = PySearch(config)

# Step 4: Use the feature
results = engine.[feature_method]("search pattern")

# Step 5: Process the results
for item in results.items:
    print(f"Found: {item.file} at line {item.start_line}")
```

## Basic Usage

### Core Functionality

#### Using `[Primary Method]`

Description of the primary way to use this feature.

```python
# Basic usage
result = engine.[method_name](parameter)

# With common options
result = engine.[method_name](
    parameter,
    option1=value1,
    option2=value2
)
```

**Parameters:**

- `parameter` (`type`): Description of the main parameter.
- `option1` (`type`, optional): Description of a common optional parameter.

**Returns:**

- Description of what is returned by the method.

### Common Patterns

#### Pattern 1: [Common Use Case]

```python
# Example of a common usage pattern
config = SearchConfig([specific_configuration])
engine = PySearch(config)
result = engine.[method]([typical_parameters])

if result.items:
    print(f"Found {len(result.items)} matches.")
else:
    print("No matches found.")
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Advanced Configuration

For more complex scenarios, you can use advanced configuration options:

```python
from pysearch.types import [AdvancedTypes]

# Advanced configuration object
advanced_config = [AdvancedTypes](
    advanced_option1=value1,
    advanced_option2=value2
)

config = SearchConfig(
    paths=["./src"],
    [feature_config]=advanced_config
)
```

### Combining with Other Features

[Feature Name] works well with other pysearch features:

```python
# Example of combining with other features
results = engine.search(
    pattern="search term",
    use_[feature]=True,
    [other_feature_option]=True
)
```

---

## Configuration

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `option1` | `str` | `"default"` | Description of what this option controls. |
| `option2` | `bool` | `True` | Description of this boolean flag. |
| `option3` | `int` | `10` | Description of this integer setting. |

### Configuration via Environment Variables

You can also configure [Feature Name] using environment variables:

```bash
export PYSEARCH_[FEATURE_OPTION]="value"
export PYSEARCH_[ANOTHER_OPTION]="true"
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: [Practical Scenario]

**Scenario:** A description of a real-world problem this feature can solve.

```python
# Complete, runnable example for the scenario
from pysearch import PySearch, SearchConfig

def example_function():
    """Example function demonstrating [Feature Name]."""
    
    config = SearchConfig(
        paths=["./src", "./tests"],
        [feature_specific_config]=True
    )
    engine = PySearch(config)
    
    results = engine.[feature_method]("example pattern")
    
    for item in results.items:
        print(f"Match in {item.file}:")
        for line in item.lines:
            print(f"  {line.strip()}")
    
    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    results = example_function()
    print(f"\nFound {len(results.items)} total matches.")
```

---

## Best Practices

### Performance

1.  **Optimize configuration**: Use `include` and `exclude` patterns to limit the search scope.
2.  **Cache results**: If you perform the same search multiple times, consider caching the results.
3.  **Use parallel processing**: Enable the `parallel` option in `SearchConfig` for large codebases.

### Code Style

1.  **Separate configuration**: Keep your `SearchConfig` objects separate from your application logic.
2.  **Handle errors gracefully**: Use `try...except` blocks to catch potential `SearchError` exceptions.

### Common Pitfalls

#### Pitfall 1: [Common Mistake]

**Problem:** A description of a common error or misunderstanding.

**Solution:**

```python
# The wrong way to do it
wrong_usage = engine.[method]([problematic_parameters])

# The correct way
correct_usage = engine.[method]([correct_parameters])
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: [Feature] Not Behaving as Expected

**Symptoms:**

- You receive an error message or unexpected behavior.

**Causes:**

- A misconfiguration of a specific option.
- An incompatibility with another feature.

**Solutions:**

1.  **Check your configuration**: Double-check the settings in your `SearchConfig` object.
2.  **Isolate the issue**: Test the feature with a minimal, simple example to confirm it works as expected.

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to get more detailed output for troubleshooting:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Your pysearch code here will now produce detailed logs
```
